    objectType: ObjectTypes; //enum: 0 none; 1 person; 2 patient; 3 player; 4 user; 5 contact; 6 concept; 11 institution; 12 outras deriva√ßoes de institution ; 21 equipments...etc. There are assessment templates that can be used for patients and concepts. In this case use assessment_template.object_type=person. But there are assessments that may be used only by concpets, in this case use assessment_template.object_type=concept, so you can filter different assessment templates depending on the context. But we also need object type here because in the case we have assessment_template.object_type=person, it means that we need to specify if the instance is being used for a patient or for a concept (both are persons).
